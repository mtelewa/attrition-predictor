[Main Article explaining the dataset and business problem](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/groupprojects/January2018FBL/IBM_Attrition_VSS.html)

The attrition predictor predicts whether an employee will remain in the workforce according to multiple factors like demographics, work culture, etc. Attrition in this context could be voulantary as well as involuntary leave from an organization for unpredictable or uncontrollable reasons. Managing and understanding attrition is pivotal for organizations to ensure a stable and engaged workforce. With a high attrition rate, a company is likely to shrink in size. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring and training new staff. Therefore, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition.

The statistical study and data analysis was carried out to understand how attrition (the target) is affected by other variables (features). The problem was treated as a classification model.

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo
1. Log into your cloud IDE with your GitHub account.
1. On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button
1. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier
1. Click Create
1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.
1. Open a new terminal and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory, and click on the notebook you want to open.
1. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

Note that the kernel says Python 3.8.18 as it inherits from the workspace, so it will be Python-3.8.18 as installed by our template. To confirm this, you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.


## Dataset Content

* **Important Note on the dataset**: This dataset was generated by IBM fictional.

* The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) and it consists of 1470 rows and 35 columns i.e. a total of 51450 data points. 9 columns are categorical of Object (or string) type while the rest (26 columns) are numerical of integer type. The following summary was obtained from `ProfileReport` imported from `ydata_profiling` library.

### The numerical columns (26 columns)
In 7 columns out of the 26, the integers denote a string value. They are explained as follows:

The bold columns with aestric (*) are dropped as they either contain only one value (Employee count, Over 18) or considered to not affect the target (Employee number). Additionally, the hourly, daily and monthly rates were dropped as they are ambiguous (mentioned also in this [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/discussion/319276)). The focus was on the monthly income instead.



## Business Requirements

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

## Set Heroku stack

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

0. Install the client in the terminal `curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh`

6. Set the stack to heroku-20 `heroku stack:set heroku-20 --app attrition-predictor`


* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
